## __SUMMARY__

I am an enthusiastic, self-motivated, reliable, responsible and hard working person. Motherhood additionally strengthened my qualities such as patience, multitasking, attention to detail. I am a mature team worker and adaptable to all challenging situations. I am able to work well both in a team environment as well as using own initiative. I am able to work well under pressure and adhere to strict deadlines.

My goal is to learn a pure JavaScript at a good level and learn the React library. I would like to work under the guidance of an experienced developer to gain practical experience.
